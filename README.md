PROGRAMMABLE LOAD SHEDDING TIME MANAGEMENT for UTILITY DEPARTMENT
Load shedding simply stated is a controlled temporary way of cutting power to parts of the country when there is not enough electricity to meet the needs of customers. This is as a result of a shortage of capacity and a high demand for electricity. 

At some particular time demand is at peak and at some time load eases off. Any problem on the system such as a breakdown at a power generation station or on a transmission line, can impact the supply to customers. When this happens, the system is unable to meet the demand of customers.  Thus there was need to implement load shedding as a last resort.

The conventional method of load shedding system needs the human involvement to press the switch on or off correspondingly to isolate the load from the entire system. Such methods are too slow to shed the needed amount of load hence insufficient load reduction occurs.

In todayâ€™s world, there is a continuous need for automatic appliances with the increase in 
standard of living. There is a sense of urgency for developing circuits that would ease the complexity of life. This is a national challenge that requires all of us to contribute towards a solution.. 

In recent years, load shedding systems have been carried out using conventional underfrequency relay or breaker interlock schemes incorporated with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). 

This project presents controlling of the electric loads as required by the operator time inputs and as per the area requirement. This method for a system intends to manage the electrical load by the programing logic in a Arduino to receive SMS in a GSM module through mobile app and switch the load automatically on or off.
